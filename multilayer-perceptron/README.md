## Multilayer perceptron

This folder of my data science repository pertains to the simple machine learning tool the multilayer perceptron (MLP). MLP involves two stages: (1) the forward pass, and (2) back-propagation.

The concept is based on taking the single perceptron concept and using multiple of them in a network. The input is turned into output during the forward pass by matrix multiplication. Subsequently, the weights are updated during the back-propagation through gradient descent and differentiation via the chain rule.

This project originally began as an exercise proposed during a university module, but has been fleshed out from a two-layer version into an N-layer version.
